# Information🗒️
I will give you two interesting information from this mod.

1. Support unit, Node. Nodes will help you build buildings and mine ore, if you command them. Even the manufacturing price is cheap!!

2. Resource Extractor: There are two versions of the Resource Extractor: the original and the second. As the name suggests, this building extracts resources using water and power. the output is random, usually copper, lead, graphite, etc.
